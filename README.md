# Improved Median Filtering for Noise Reduction with Python

Although the median filter is suitable for eliminating noise in images, it is an expensive algorithm in processing time. This repository aims to try new, fast median filtering algorithms developed in the paper named "An Improved Median Filtering Algorithm for Image Noise Reduction" by Youlian Zhu and Cheng Huang.
